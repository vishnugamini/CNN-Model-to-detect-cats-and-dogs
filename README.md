# CNN Model to Detect Animals

CNN Model to Detect Animals is a deep learning project that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images and detect different animals. By training a CNN model on a labeled dataset of animal images, this project aims to accurately identify and classify animals in unseen images.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of a large collection of 10 thousand labeled images of cats and dogs.

## Model Architecture

- The CNN model consists of 2 convolutional layers followed by a Dense layer.
- Max pooling is used with a pool size of 2 to extract features.
- Images are scaled to a size of 150x150 pixels.
- Various transformations are applied to augment the images, helping to prevent overfitting.

## Training Details

- The model is trained for 30 epochs
- The training process utilized the entire dataset of 10 thousand images.
- The model achieved an accuracy rate of 90%.
