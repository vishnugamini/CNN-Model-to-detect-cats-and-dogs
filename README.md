## Convulutinal neural network to detect cats and dogs
This is a CNN model built using a large dataset of 10 thousand pictures and has the capability to differentiate between a dog and a cat.
It uses 2 convolutional layers and one Dense layer. Max pooling was used to extract features with a pool size of 2. 
Images were scaled to 150X150 size, different transformations were applied to augument all the images to avoid overfitting.
epochs was set to 30 which essentially means the model went over the data set 30 times.

# Implication
Achieved 90 percent accuracy rate
